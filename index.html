                <h3>Web Development</h3>
                <p class=>I first learned how to code when I was 17 years old and taught k-5 students how to code 
                    and properly execute a computer game. I was on and off with coding but soon picked it 
                    back up in 2021 and earned my first certification which was for responsive web design 
                    in August 2021. I am now currently taking a Complete Web Development course on Udemy 
                    by the London App Brewery and I hope to be certified by early next year and hope to 
                    land a job as a developer. Love the journey so far!

                <h3>Advocacy</h3>
                <p class=>As a political science major, I always had the interest in working in politics or in the nonprofit industry and making a difference in communities. 
                    I used to work at Comite Civico del Valle, a non-profit organization located in Imperial County. 
                    Imperial County is the poorest County in the State of California and has the second highest unemployment rate in the United States so 
                    I gained a mass amount of experience working with underserved and disadvantaged communities. I attended and planned many events during my time there. 
                    I performed outreach to the hard to reach communities to listen to their needs and attended meetings with government officials to update them on 
                    our needs, the most notable government official being the Secretary of the Department of Energy of the United States. We spoke to the Secretary about
                    the importance of lithium in our transition to green energy and reducing our reliance on fossile fuels. Also, the importance of building up Imperial County
                    and making it an economic powerhouse due to the lithium found in the County. The experience I acquired in my tenure is unmatched and I continue to
                    acquire more experience in advocacy by participating in local meetings as a volunteer.
